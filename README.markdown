RubyScriptLibrary
=================

RubyScriptLibrary is a set of various scripts to perform random utility functions.  Consider these files as my prototyping set of classes that I don't want to lose in case I find a use for them.  Some of the ideas I've used in other projects, and others I've kept stored here for future projects I want to utilize these for.  Freely take these as you want and use them for your own projects.
