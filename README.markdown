RubyScriptLibrary
=================

RubyScriptLibrary is a set of various scripts to perform random utility functions.  Consider these files as my prototyping set of classes that I don't want to lose in case I find a use for them.  Some of the ideas I've used in other projects, and others I've kept stored here for future projects I want to utilize these for.  Freely take these as you want and use them for your own projects.


Note
----

Some of these scripts were pulled off of the web from various other sources and authors much brighter than myself.  I have attributed the implementation of these where possible, but if I miss anything, feel free to contact me regarding this and I will correct it immediately.
